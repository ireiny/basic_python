Comparison of Moscow and St. Petersburg is surrounded by myths. For example:

- Moscow is a metropolis subject to the rigid rhythm of the working week;
- Petersburg is a cultural capital, with its own tastes.

Using Music sevice data, you will compare the behavior of users in the two capitals.

The research purpose is to test three hypotheses:

- User activity depends on the day of the week. Moreover, in Moscow and St. Petersburg this manifests itself in different ways.
- On a Monday morning, certain genres dominate in Moscow, while others dominate in St. Petersburg. Similarly, Friday evenings are dominated by different genres, depending on the city.
- Moscow and St. Petersburg prefer different genres of music. In Moscow, they listen to pop music more often, in St. Petersburg - Russian rap.

Research progress

We will receive data on user behavior from the yandex_music_project.csv file. Nothing is known about the quality of the data. Therefore, before testing hypotheses, a review of the data is required.

We will check the data for errors and assess their impact on the study. Then, in the pre-processing phase, we will look for opportunities to correct the most critical data errors.

Thus, the study will take place in three stages:

- Data review.
- Data preprocessing.
- Hypothesis testing.
